# What is this?

In Republic of Ireland, DJEI (Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation) publishes on a daily basis (they try to...) an update about **current processing dates** for Employment Permits.

**djei-api** pulls all this data from [DJEI official website](https://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Jobs-Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Current-Application-Processing-Dates/) and make it available for you.

# Documentation

**https://api.djei.goenning.net/{date}?interval={interval}&format={format}**

- {date} is **required** and formatted as YYYY-MM-DD
- {interval} specifies the range of days to retrieve. Interval is optional and defaults to **0**. Value must be between **-30** and **30**.
- {format} is optional and can be either **raw** or **date**. Defaults to **date**.

This operation returns processing date for given **{date}** in the past. Future dates should not be used for obvious reasons ðŸ¤“

Historical data is available since **2017-05-10**.

**https://api.djei.goenning.net/now** 

Fetches **current** dates from DJEI official website. A live pull is performed, hence it's slower than other methods.
If you need data from today, please use operation above with current date as a parameter.

**Examples:**

- https://api.djei.goenning.net/2017-05-16?interval=-1 Retrieves 2017-05-16 and 2017-05-15
- https://api.djei.goenning.net/2017-05-14?interval=2 Retrieves 2017-05-14, 2017-05-15 and 2017-05-16
- https://api.djei.goenning.net/2017-05-14?format=raw Retrieves 2017-05-14 with dates in epoch forma
